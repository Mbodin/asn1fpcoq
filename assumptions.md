This project's ASN.1 Real encoding implementation  is designed to comply with the definitions set out by [ISO/IEC 8825-1:2015 Standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/68345.html), in particular, with the Basic Encoding Rules, described in section [8].

However, the following limitations currently apply:

* Only binary encoding [8.5.7] is considered, leaving decimal encoding [8.5.8] out of the project`s scope.
* Only short form [8.1.3.4] encoding is considered, leaving long form [8.1.3.5] out of the project's scope.
