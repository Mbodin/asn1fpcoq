\begin{abstract}

ASN.1 encoding is widely used for data transfer between various computing systems.
Such data may contain floating-point numbers. The most common representation of
floating-point numbers is the IEEE 754 standard. ASN.1, however, does not rely
on IEEE for that task. Conversion between the two floating-point
representations is error-prone in most ASN.1 protocol implementations. In this
project, we formalize such conversion and prove it's correctness using the Coq
proof assistant. Such formalization could be used as an ``executable specification'' which
could be extracted as an OCaml or Haskell program. The secondary goal of this project is
to assess the amount of work required for formalizing the full ASN.1 stack, which
we are considering as the next step.

\section{Introduction}

At the fundamental level, any floating-point number is a pair of integers: a \textit{mantissa}
(sometimes also called \textit{significand}) and an \textit{exponent}. The main difference between
standards for floating-point representation is how this pair is encoded. Different binary lengths
might be used, or different representations for special values might be chosen among other variances. These variations in encoding
are adapted for assorted use-cases but create complications when conversion from one format to another
is required.

An instance of this, which is handled in our project, is the conversion between floating-point numbers,
encoded in IEEE 754, and ASN.1 formats. It is a common task but not a simple one.
Mere numbers: while any IEEE encoding consists of three different parts, an ASN.1 float has at least nine.

To give you an example, in the \emph{asn1c} \cite{walkinopen} project, the function
converting between the two formats takes around 200 lines of C code.
It is quite hard for a human to verify, making a formalization of the topic a much-needed endeavor.

\section{Brief format comparison}

In the scope of this project, two formats are considered: the IEEE 754 binary
interchange floating-point encoding \cite{5976968} and the ASN.1 BER real value encoding \cite{ISO8825}.
IEEE 754 defines formats of varying lengths, \emph{binary32} and \emph{binary64}
being the most commonly used. Any IEEE 754 floating-point number can be thought of as a triplet:
$(\mathrm{sign}, \mathrm{exp}, \mathrm{mantissa}) \in \bool \times \Z \times \N$,
which is serialized as a concatenation of bit sequences representing each of the components.

The core part of any ASN.1 real encoding has the following form:
$ (\mathrm{sign},\mathrm{radix},\mathrm{scaling},\mathrm{exp},\mathrm{mantissa})
\in \bool \times \N \times \N \times \Z \times \N$.
The serialization scheme for this is more complicated, using additional
information about the encoding variants.

Both standards define more than one encoding scheme, but for the purposes of
this project, only binary formats are considered: those, in which the exponent uses a base
which is a power of two. In addition to real values, the standards support the same set
of special values. However, an IEEE \emph{NaN} value loses its debugging payload when conversion to
ASN.1 is performed.

While consisting of blocks of similar meaning, ASN.1 and IEEE 754 represent the same numbers in different
ways. For example, the number $0.46875 = 15*2^{-5}$ corresponds to the $(0, 125, 7340032)$ tuple
in IEEE binary32 and $(0, 16, 2, 254, 29)$ ASN.1 real encoding.

It is important to note that any number in \emph{binary64} or \emph{binary32} IEEE format can
be converted to ASN.1 without loss of precision. Conversely, an ASN.1-encoded
number is not necessarily representable in any common IEEE format. For such cases,
rounding is implemented, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:imp}.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:imp}
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{diagram.eps}
  \caption{Full conversion scheme}
  \label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

The conversion path is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:figure1}. We use $\Z$ to
represent bit strings of arbitrary length. Both BER and IEEE floating-point
numbers are ultimately encoded as such strings. The conversion is split into
several steps with intermediate representations. On the IEEE side, there is
\emph{binary\_float}, defined in the Flocq \cite{boldo2011flocq} library, which provides
an abstract representation of floats as an inductive type with constructors for
special values as well as ``regular'' numbers expressed as a mantissa-exponent
pair. On ASN.1 side, there is the \emph{BER\_float} inductive type, which is similar
to \emph{binary\_float}, with some additional parameters unique to BER added, and the
\emph{BER\_bitstring} type, which is used as an intermediate type for generating sequences of bits.

For each adjacent pair of formats, we need to define two conversion functions
for both directions, a heterogeneous equality and lemmas ensuring equivalence
of conversion results.

In general, our conversion function from type $T$ to $U$ is not total.
The converter may fail for some values of $T$ which could not be
represented in $U$. To express this, our converters have the type $T \rightarrow \mathrm{option}\, U$,
using the \emph{Option Monad}. In case of error, \emph{None} is returned.
This allows us to define a generic ``round-trip'' conversion correctness property as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Definition roundtrip
           (A1 B A2 : Type)
           (f : A1 -> option B) (* forward pass *)
           (b : B -> option A2) (* backward pass *)
           (e : A1 -> A2 -> bool)   (* equality *)
           (x : A1)            (* value *)
  : Prop :=
    is_Some_b (f x) = true ->
    bool_het_inverse option A1 B A2 f b e x = Some true.
\end{lstlisting}

The original expression of type $A1$ is converted using ``forward'' conversion
pass to type $B$ and then back using ``backward'' pass to type $A1$. For example, a practical scenario
for this could be encoding ($f$) a \emph{binary32} ($A1$) float in BER ($B$), transmitting it over a
network, and decoding ($b$) into \emph{binary64} ($A2$). The results
of successful forward conversion must satisfy a heterogeneous equality
predicate \emph{e}, which is applied using the \emph{bool\_het\_inverse} wrapper:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
Definition bo$$ol_het_inverse
  (m : Type -> Type) `{Monad m}
  (A1 B A2 : Type)
  (f : A1 -> m B)  (b : B -> m A2)
  (e : A1 -> A2 -> bool) (x : A1) : m bool := 
  y <- f x ;;
    x' <- b y ;;
      ret (e x x').
\end{lstlisting}

It should be noted that, while we call it a ``round-trip,'' the result
of the backwards pass ($A2$) does not have the same type as the original value ($A1$).
The reason for this is the need to convert between different formats of IEEE 754. For
example, a \emph{binary64} floating-point number might be transmitted using BER format
to a different machine where it needs to be represented in \emph{binary32}.
In such cases, rounding might need to be performed during conversion from BER to IEEE.
This is supported in our implementation, with the roundtrip conversion behaving exactly as if the
original number was converted to a different format according to the rules set out in IEEE 754.

For the common IEEE 754 binary formats, high-level encoding and decoding functions are defined.
For example for \emph{binary64}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Coq, mathescape=true,
  basicstyle=\footnotesize]
    Definition float64_to_BER_exact (f : Z) : option Z :=
      ab <- b64_to_BER_abstract (b64_of_bits f) ;;
        ret (BER_to_bits ab).

    Definition BER_to_float64_exact (asn : Z) : option Z :=
      bf <- bits_to_BER asn ;;
        af <- BER_to_b64_abstract_exact bf ;;
          ret (bits_of_b64 af).

    Definition BER_to_float64_rounded
      (rounding : mode ) (asn : Z) : option Z :=
        bf <- bits_to_BER asn ;;
          af <- BER_to_b64_abstract_rounded rounding bf ;;
            ret (bits_of_b64 af).
\end{lstlisting}

The implementation is straightforward. It proceeds by converting a bit string in the
source format into the target through intermediate steps corresponding to
intermediate formats previously introduced in this paper. If an error occurs at any step
(\emph{None} returned), it is propagated to the final result through monadic composition of the steps.

\section{Results and Future work}

To demonstrate how our verified implementation could be used in a practical ASN.1 encoding/decoding
pipeline, we exported our encoder and decoder implementation in Gallina as an OCaml program using
Coq \textit{extraction} \cite{letouzey2008extraction} facility. 

The resulting implementation was then linked to the asn1c library, replacing native implementation of the
floating point encoding module. It then passed all unit tests. The performance of
the extracted code is, as expected, slower compared to the original C implementation.

To combine benefits of formal verification with high performance of native
implementation, we plan  to try to verify existing C implementation as the next step
using our formalization as the specification. We are considering using
VST \cite{appel2011verified} and the CompCert compiler \cite {leroy2012compcert}. 

The ultimate goal is to verify the full ASN.1 stack. This is a formidable task, as
ASN.1 specification is very rich and includes multiple encoding formats
(binary, XML, etc.) and even it's own embedded constraint language. We are
seeking industrial and academic partners to collaborate on this project.
